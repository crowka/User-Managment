Follow this plan! Remember that we need to build this as a separate building block that can be plugged into any app. It must be versatile and flexible. We currently use Supabase, but we might want to use other database for other services. Contain all code clean and easy to replace. Keep front and back end separated. Always ask if you have several options and you are not sure. This app has to work with both web and mobile application. It has to be plugguble and all functionalities that are not absolute core have to be easy to turn on and off for different apps.
